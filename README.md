##### Overview:



##### Data:

This data set has been taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository, Centre for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems. You can find the dataset [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/mushroom).

This data set includes descriptions of hypothetical samples
corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family.  

Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended.  This latter class was combined with the poisonous one.  

Number of observations: 8124

Number of attributes (features) = 22

Attributes: cap-shape, cap-surface, cap-color, bruises, odor, gill-attachment, gill-spacing, gill-size, gill-color, stalk-shape, stalk-root, stalk-surface-above-ring, stalk-surface-below-ring, stalk-color-above-ring, stalk-color-below-ring, veil-type, veil-color, ring-number, ring-type, spore-print-color, population and habitat.
